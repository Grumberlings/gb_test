# History

Graham Brooks was trained in Industrial Design at Newcastle Polytechnic and obtained a master’s in Industrial Design at Birmingham Polytechnic. Based in London during the 90s he created site-specific sculptural lighting designs for restaurants and bars. He next moved into the CGI arena producing 3D computer animation for video and TV.  This led to a research post at the University of Nottingham using real-time graphics for virtual reality and ‘serious games’. As one of the founding members of Mission Room Ltd. he spent the next decade transforming this research into applications for industry.

# Artist Statement

Graham Brooks uses repeating components and contrasting organic elements to explore ideas around artificiality, permanence, ownership, and waste.

His work also focuses on the effect of wear on objects and these marks of making and use can suggest traces of a human presence on sterile and unyielding products.

Using a series of component parts as a starting point he works in plaster polymer and felt to give a physical presence to the question of what is natural and what is artificial?

He uses a process led, material-based practice where the hands-on act of making is integral. The unique and hand-made is important. The slow repetitive process of making each ‘master’ component and the unplanned act of bringing the finished into being contrasts with the visual language of design for mass manufacture.
