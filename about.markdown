# Artist Statement

Graham Brooks uses repeating elements and contrasting materials to explore ideas around artificiality, permanence, ownership, and waste.

He is also interested in the effect of wear and how marks of making and of handling an object leave traces of a human presence.

His currently works predominantly in Plaster Polymer and Felt to give to evoke the question of what is natural and what is artificial in a world driven by the production of sterile and unyielding products.

He uses a process led, material-based practice where the hands-on act of making is integral. The unique and hand-made is important. The slow repetitive process of making each ‘master’ component and the spontaneous act of assembly plays with the process of design, mass manufacture and consumption.

Living and working in Nottingham, U.K.
