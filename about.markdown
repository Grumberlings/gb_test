# Artist Statement

Graham Brooks uses repeating cast components and contrasting organic elements to explore ideas around the artificiality, perminance and ownership.

Fasinated by the effect of wear objects and how these marks of making and use suggest traces of a human presence on our often sterile and unyielding surroundings. 

Using a series of component parts as a starting point he works in plaster polymer and felt to give a physical presence what is natural, what is man made? What are the positive and negative aspects 

Fascinated by the containing function of the vessel and its connotations with the human body, where external surface and shape are often the defining characteristics rather than what is contained; she plays with these aspects trying to destabilise or reinforce them.

Often working in sequence, she is interested in how we view the individual as a distinct entity and what happens when it becomes part of a group or a larger whole. Do we perceive its inherent characteristics or those relative to what is around it?

The unique and hand-made is important as it acts as a counterpoint to the visual refernces to mass manufacture and the effemeral. 
He uses a process led, material based practice where the hands on act of making is integral. The slow repetitive process of working with components is important, contrasting with the visual language of mass manufactuer.
