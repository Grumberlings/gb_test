## Artist Statement

Graham Brooks works predominantly in sculpture, using a process led, material-based practice where the hands-on act of making is integral.  He uses repeating parts to explore ideas around artificiality and permanence. While their surface appearance might appear manufactured each piece is unique and the marks of making suggest a natural process or human presence.

# Industry
When based in London during the 90’s he created a series of site-specific luminaires for restaurants, nightclubs, and bars.
In the late 90’s he moved into 3D computer graphics, creating animation for video and TV.

This led to a research position at the University of Nottingham creating real-time 3D graphics for virtual reality and ‘serious games’.

As one of the founding members of Mission Room he spent the next decade transforming this research into applications for industry.
