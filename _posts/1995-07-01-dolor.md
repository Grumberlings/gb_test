This project was inspired by the poem Dolor by Theodore Roethke:

<h5>I have known the inexorable sadness of pencils,<br>
Neat in their boxes, dolor of pad and paper weight,<br>
All the misery of manilla folders and mucilage,<br>
Desolation in immaculate public places,<br>
Lonely reception room, lavatory, switchboard,<br>
The unalterable pathos of basin and pitcher,<br>
Ritual of multigraph, paper-clip, comma,<br>
Endless duplication of lives and objects.<br>
And I have seen dust from the walls of institutions,<br>
Finer than flour, alive, more dangerous than silica,<br>
Sift, almost invisible, through long afternoons of tedium,<br>
Dropping a fine film on nails and delicate eyebrows,<br>
Glazing the pale hair, the duplicate grey standard faces.</h5>

The exhibition was at The Battersea Arts Centre in London.
