This peice was the third of my components series where I use a series of hand made parts to construct a unique one off sculpture.

*Components 4*

Usually a sculptor makes a unique 'master' from which they cast a series of copies.

I reverse this and create a suite of repeating parts that I can combine into a series of 'one off' pieces.
