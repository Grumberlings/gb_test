The repeating components, with brightly coloured and polished surfaces possibly suggest the appearance of consumer products. However, each has individual properties and organic imperfections, displaying the marks of making and perhaps damage or wear. 

Component parts are cast in batches and form a pallet of options. Each unique piece slowly grows driven by the selection from this pallet and a response to the form and surface properties of the piece.
