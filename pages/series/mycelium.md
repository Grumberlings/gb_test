*Mycelium Series*

Mycelium are a mass of branched, tubular filaments of fungi. Essential for healthy soils and plant growth they also break down dead vegatable matter. I find this ambiguity interesting. Are the fibres helpful or destructive, friendly or threatening? I have used felted lambswool to represent these 'natural' elements that interact with the hard plaster polmer cast components.
