*Components Series*

I tend to cast the component parts in batches with little notion of what form and colour the final piece will take. The range of options from which I can choose allows me to quite spontaneous in the creation of the final form.

The repeating elements, brightly coloured and polished surfaces might suggest the appearance of consumer products. On closer inspection they are obviously hand crafted with each having individual elements and organic imperfections.
