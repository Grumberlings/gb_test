*Components Series*

I tend to cast the parts in batches with only a vague notion of what form and colour the final piece will take. This means I have a range of options from which to choose and allows me to make sculptures in quite a spontaneous way. 

The repeating elements, brightly coloured and polished surfaces give the pieces the appearance of consumer products. On closer inspection they are obviously hand crafted with each having individual elements and organic imperfections.
